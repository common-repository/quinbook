With one click, the QB TicketShop Helper integrates the TicketShop into QuinBook users' Wordpress sites

QuinBook is the leading software solution for all business processes of leisure providers: QuinBook has been handling marketing, administration and personnel tasks as well as smart ticket bookings in a comprehensive and innovative way for many years.

To make setting up the proprietary QuinBook TicketShop even easier, we provide QuinBook users with the free plugin QB TicketShop Helper.

With this smart helper, implementing and placing the QuinBock TicketShop is as easy as a mouse click - the Helper completely eliminates the need to involve a web specialist who is familiar with JAVA scripts, as copying or customising software code is no longer necessary. The only task that remains is to enter the TicketShop ID from the Quinbock backend!
